# Aethel: Coding RPG Adventure

## Purpose

Define the main purpose of this project.

## Target Users

Describe who will use this.


## Project Summary

Aethel is a story-driven, competitive coding RPG where players (Architects) fight Code Corruption by solving algorithmic challenges in an immersive AI-generated narrative world



Aethel is a narrative-driven online gaming platform where players take the role of "Architects" who solve algorithmic challenges to save a corrupted digital world. The game combines programming education with immersive storytelling, featuring AI-generated narratives, PvP competitions, class progression systems, and community features.



## Goals

- Create immersive coding education through RPG storytelling
- Build competitive programming community
- Implement AI-driven narrative that reacts to player performance
- Develop class progression system based on algorithmic domains
- Enable cooperative dungeons and PvP coding battles



- Create an engaging educational gaming experience that teaches programming concepts
- Build a scalable multiplayer platform with real-time features
- Implement a comprehensive progression system with character classes
- Develop AI-driven narrative generation for personalized storytelling
- Foster a competitive community through leaderboards and PvP systems



## Constraints

- Web-based platform
- Real-time code execution
- AI narrative generation costs
- Scalable multiplayer architecture



- Must be performant as a web application
