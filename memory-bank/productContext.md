# Product Context

## Project Description

Aethel is a dark fantasy coding education platform that teaches Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through an epic, immersive narrative experience. The platform combines 80% fantasy storytelling with 20% subtle logical elements to create engaging educational content.

## Core Narrative Principles

### Meta-Awareness Foundation
- **Earth Origin**: Player character originates from normal world with existing programming knowledge
- **Natural Justification**: Logical thinking skills from Earth translate to survival abilities in fantasy realm
- **Familiar References**: Player can reference their normal world experience when appropriate
- **Consistent Difficulty**: Easy problems in early chapters, scaling systematically to Hard problems

### Technical Language Subtlety
- **Primary Language**: Fantasy/RPG terminology (villages, towers, bridges, ancient magic, guilds, quests)
- **Secondary Elements**: Logical/mathematical concepts when necessary for puzzle context
- **Avoid**: Direct programming terminology in narrative descriptions unless absolutely necessary
- **Exception**: Technical terms allowed in actual problem statements and character dialogue about specific challenges

Aethel is a dark fantasy story-driven coding education platform that teaches Data Structures and Algorithms through immersive narrative gameplay. Players take on the role of a programmer transported from Earth to a cursed realm where their logical thinking abilities become supernatural powers with dangerous consequences.

## Core Features

### Story-Driven Learning
- **Dark Fantasy Narrative**: Inspired by Shadow Slave and Lord of the Mysteries
- **Meta Origin Story**: Player comes from Earth, fell asleep while coding, awakens in fantasy realm
- **Three-Path Prologue**: Village Gate Crisis (Two Sum), Ancient Symbols (Linear Search), Mountain Perspective (Basic Sorting)
- **Consistent Difficulty Scaling**: Easy (Chapters 1-84) → Easy-Medium (85-168) → Medium (169-252) → Medium-Hard (253-336) → Hard (337-420)
- **Character Consequences**: NPCs react to player's growing logical abilities with fear/fascination/isolation

### DSA Integration  
- **Beginner-Friendly Start**: Two Sum, Linear Search, Basic Sorting in prologue and early chapters
- **LeetCode-Style Challenges**: Real Python coding problems embedded in story context
- **Natural Problem Emergence**: Challenges arise organically from narrative needs, not forced technical insertion
- **Algorithm Progression**: Arrays/Search → Hash Maps → Basic Trees → Graph Theory → Dynamic Programming → Advanced Optimization
- **Time/Space Complexity**: Educational focus on algorithmic analysis without overwhelming narrative

### Gamification Elements
- **Character Classes**: Based on algorithmic specializations (Array Master, Graph Sage, DP Specialist)
- **RPG Progression**: Experience gained through problem solving
- **PvP Competitions**: Head-to-head coding battles
- **Cooperative Dungeons**: Team-based algorithmic challenges

## Technical Stack

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark fantasy theme
- **UI Components**: Custom RPG-styled interface
- **Deployment**: Vercel for optimal Next.js performance

### Backend (Hono on Cloudflare Workers)
