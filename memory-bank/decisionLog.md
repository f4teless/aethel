# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-14 | Use SvelteKit over Next.js for the frontend framework | SvelteKit provides better performance characteristics, smaller bundle sizes, and more intuitive reactivity patterns. The compile-time optimizations and smaller runtime overhead are beneficial for a gaming platform where performance is critical. |
| 2025-07-14 | Adopt oRPC for API communication instead of traditional REST | oRPC provides end-to-end type safety, automatic API documentation, and better developer experience. This reduces runtime errors and improves development velocity, which is crucial for a complex gaming platform with multiple API endpoints. |
| 2025-07-14 | Deploy on Cloudflare Workers and Pages | Cloudflare's edge network provides global low-latency access critical for gaming applications. Workers offer excellent cold start performance and automatic scaling. The integrated platform simplifies deployment and provides built-in DDoS protection and CDN capabilities. |
| 2025-07-14 | Use PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence | PostgreSQL provides robust relational data management needed for complex gaming relationships (users, classes, leaderboards, etc.). Drizzle ORM offers type-safe database operations while maintaining performance. The combination supports both simple and complex queries required for gaming analytics. |
| 2025-07-14 | Implement a cyberpunk/fantasy theme with immersive storytelling | The theme differentiates the platform from traditional coding education tools and creates emotional engagement. The "Architects debugging a corrupted digital world" narrative makes programming concepts more accessible and memorable through storytelling. |
| 2025-07-14 | Migrate frontend from SvelteKit to Next.js | Next.js provides better React ecosystem support, more extensive community resources, and better integration with educational platform requirements. The App Router and React Server Components offer performance benefits and improved developer experience for complex gaming interfaces. |
| 2025-07-14 | Deploy frontend on Vercel instead of Cloudflare Pages | Vercel is optimized specifically for Next.js applications with features like Edge Runtime, automatic performance optimizations, and seamless integration with Next.js features. This provides better performance and developer experience for the React-based frontend. |
| 2025-07-14 | Add Google authentication alongside GitHub | Google authentication significantly increases user accessibility and conversion rates, as most users have Google accounts. This reduces friction in the onboarding process for educational platforms and provides more authentication options for diverse user preferences. |
