# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-14 | Use SvelteKit over Next.js for the frontend framework | SvelteKit provides better performance characteristics, smaller bundle sizes, and more intuitive reactivity patterns. The compile-time optimizations and smaller runtime overhead are beneficial for a gaming platform where performance is critical. |
| 2025-07-14 | Adopt oRPC for API communication instead of traditional REST | oRPC provides end-to-end type safety, automatic API documentation, and better developer experience. This reduces runtime errors and improves development velocity, which is crucial for a complex gaming platform with multiple API endpoints. |
| 2025-07-14 | Deploy on Cloudflare Workers and Pages | Cloudflare's edge network provides global low-latency access critical for gaming applications. Workers offer excellent cold start performance and automatic scaling. The integrated platform simplifies deployment and provides built-in DDoS protection and CDN capabilities. |
| 2025-07-14 | Use PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence | PostgreSQL provides robust relational data management needed for complex gaming relationships (users, classes, leaderboards, etc.). Drizzle ORM offers type-safe database operations while maintaining performance. The combination supports both simple and complex queries required for gaming analytics. |
| 2025-07-14 | Implement a cyberpunk/fantasy theme with immersive storytelling | The theme differentiates the platform from traditional coding education tools and creates emotional engagement. The "Architects debugging a corrupted digital world" narrative makes programming concepts more accessible and memorable through storytelling. |
| 2025-07-14 | Migrate frontend from SvelteKit to Next.js | Next.js provides better React ecosystem support, more extensive community resources, and better integration with educational platform requirements. The App Router and React Server Components offer performance benefits and improved developer experience for complex gaming interfaces. |
| 2025-07-14 | Deploy frontend on Vercel instead of Cloudflare Pages | Vercel is optimized specifically for Next.js applications with features like Edge Runtime, automatic performance optimizations, and seamless integration with Next.js features. This provides better performance and developer experience for the React-based frontend. |
| 2025-07-14 | Add Google authentication alongside GitHub | Google authentication significantly increases user accessibility and conversion rates, as most users have Google accounts. This reduces friction in the onboarding process for educational platforms and provides more authentication options for diverse user preferences. |
| 2025-07-15 | Completed comprehensive performance optimization and refactoring of Aethel codebase | Successfully implemented all major performance optimizations requested by user including: code splitting with lazy loading, service worker caching, image optimization, performance monitoring, error boundaries, authentication system completion, and environment validation. All optimizations preserve the existing RPG-themed styling while significantly improving application performance, user experience, and developer workflow. Created comprehensive documentation and monitoring tools for ongoing performance management. |
| 2025-07-15 | Created unique RPG-style floating orb navigation system for authenticated game routes | User requested something unique for RPG coding experience that differs from traditional websites like LeetCode. Implemented a mystical floating orb that expands into a radial portal menu, providing access to dungeons, quests, skilltree, leaderboard, profile, and dashboard. Includes player status bar with XP progression, theme toggle as day/night cycle, and ambient background effects. This creates an immersive gaming experience while maintaining practical functionality for navigation between coding sections. |
