## Current Goals

- Successfully analyzed and documented the entire Aethel project architecture. The project is a sophisticated educational gaming platform that combines programming education with immersive storytelling. Key architectural decisions have been captured, system patterns identified, and development progress tracked. The monorepo structure with Next.js frontend and Hono backend provides a solid foundation for scalable game development. Next focus should be on implementing game mechanics and AI-driven narrative features.
