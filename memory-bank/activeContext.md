# Active Context

## Current Goals

- Currently designing the comprehensive framework for Aethel's 420-chapter story structure with balanced topic distribution and nested reality layers. The platform will cover 1,260+ DSA problems through an epic fantasy narrative that reveals multiple storylines (Code Corruption, Memory Architect, Pattern Wars, Logic Plague) as layered realities. Each mobile-optimized chapter contains 3 problems naturally integrated into story flow, with reality revelations enabling infinite platform expansion.

## Current Focus

- Organizing story content around key algorithmic concepts  
- Designing a progressive difficulty curve from Easy (prologue) to Hard (climactic arcs)  
- Mapping player character progression to algorithmic thinking styles (e.g. greedy, recursive, graph traversal)
- Introducing narrative consequences based on problem-solving style (e.g. overfitting â†’ corrupted outcomes)
